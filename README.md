## About
Cohesion is heavily inspired by the [Apostrophe](https://apps.gnome.org/en/Apostrophe/) text editor, by [Manuel Genov√©s](https://gitlab.gnome.org/somas), but built for a web environment and with extra features! It uses [CodeMirror 5](https://codemirror.net/) to render syntax highlighting and [Showdownjs](https://showdownjs.com/) to parse Markdown.
