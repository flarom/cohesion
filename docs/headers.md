# Headers

In documentation, headings of different sizes are used to organize content into clear, logical sections. Larger headings introduce major topics, while smaller ones break those topics down into subsections, helping readers quickly understand the structure and find specific information. 

Markdown handles headings by using the `#` symbol at the start of a line: the number of `#` symbols defines the heading's level, from one `#` for the largest heading (level 1) up to six `#` symbols for the smallest (level 6). 

For example:

```Markdown
# Main Title
creates a primary heading

## Section Title
makes a secondary heading

### Subsection Title
creates a tertiary heading
```

This simple syntax makes it easy to create well-structured documents without needing complex formatting tools.
