# Quoting text

Quoting text in Markdown is useful for emphasizing specific blocks of information, such as notes, tips, warnings, or citations. This helps readers quickly identify important content within a document, improving both comprehension and usability. To create a simple quote in Markdown, you just need to start a line with the `>` symbol.

For example:

```markdown
> This is a quoted text.
```

When rendered, it will appear as:

> [!Example]
>> This is a quoted text.

This is often used for highlighting excerpts, emphasizing key ideas, or indicating that content is being cited from another source.

## Quote Annotations

Beyond simple quotes, annotation blocks are a common way to present categorized information like tips, warnings, or important notes. In Markdown, these can be written using the `>` symbol followed by a specific label in square brackets to indicate the type of annotation. For example:

```markdown
> [!NOTE]
> Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.

> [!TIP]
> Helpful advice for doing things better or more easily.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key information users need to know to achieve their goal.

> [!WARNING]
> Urgent information that requires immediate user attention to prevent problems.

> [!CAUTION]
> A warning about potential risks or negative consequences of certain actions.
```

When rendered, these annotations are typically displayed with visual cues that make their purpose clear:

> [!Example]
>> [!NOTE]
>> Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.
>
>> [!TIP]
>> Helpful advice for doing things better or more easily.
>
>> [!IMPORTANT]
>> Key information users need to know to achieve their goal.
>
>> [!WARNING]
>> Urgent information that requires immediate user attention to prevent problems.
>
>> [!CAUTION]
>> A warning about potential risks or negative consequences of certain actions.

This system makes it easy to organize and highlight essential content within your documentation, ensuring that readers can quickly grasp and act on important details.
